\section{Notation}
First order differential of u w.r.t t
\begin{equation}
	\frac{du}{dt}
\end{equation}
Second order differential of u w.r.t t
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\Delta u (x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{d^2u}{dx_i^2} (x) = 0

\section{Equations}

\subsection{Heat Equation}

\begin{equation}
	\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Example}

Is he following equation a solution to the heat equation

\[ u = \frac{1}{2} x^2 + t \]

Check

\[ \frac{du}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{d}{dt} t\]

\[ \frac{du}{dt} = 1\]

\[ \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{d}{dx} t\]

\[ \frac{du}{dx} = x \]

\[ \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 1 \]



\[\therefore \frac{du}{dt} = \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \]
\subsection*{Family of Solutions}

The following equation can generate an infinite number of solutions to the heat equation.

\[ u = e ^{ax + bt}\]

We can determine what a and b can represent as follows

\[ \frac{du}{dt} = e ^{ax + bt} \frac{d(ax+bt)}{dt}\]
\[ = e^{ax + bt}\cdot b\]

\[ \frac{du}{dx} = e ^{ax + bt}\frac{d(ax+bt)}{dx}\]
\[ = e^{ax + bt}\cdot a\]
\[ \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}=e^{ax + bt}\cdot a^2\]

\[ e^{ax + bt}\cdot b=e^{ax + bt}\cdot a^2\]
\[ \therefore b=a^2\]

\subsection{Wave Equation}

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = t^2 \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Derivation}

Model a string being moved up and down in a flat plane. Due to the nature of the string the force acting upon it to return to the y=0 axis is proportional to the "concavity".

Force = F = ma

Since acceleration is the 2nd derivative to position

F = m $\cdot$ $\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}$

Concavity can be modelled as the 2nd derivative of the shape of the string, since we are describing the degree of the curve the string is creating

$\therefore \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}$

Since we now have both sides of the equation but we are missing $c^2$. We can compare the units each side so far.

where c2 is the velocity of the string
